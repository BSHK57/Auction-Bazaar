# AuctionBazaar

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.0.

## Development server

Navigate to Frontend Directory
```bash
cd Auction-Bazaar
```

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Running the Backend Server  

The backend for AuctionBazaar must be started separately. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.  

### Steps to Run the Backend  

1. Navigate to the Backend directory:  

   ```bash
   cd auction-backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:  

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:  

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. By default, the backend will run on `http://localhost:3000/`. Update the frontend configuration if needed to match the correct backend URL.
